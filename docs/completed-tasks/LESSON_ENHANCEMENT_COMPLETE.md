# MVL-LMS Lesson Page - Complete Professional Redesign

## ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE LESSON FORMAT IMPLEMENTED**

I've completely redesigned the lesson page to match your professional, detailed format with all the sections you specified. This creates a much more comprehensive and engaging learning experience.

## 🎯 **Enhanced Lesson Structure**

### **📋 Complete Section Coverage:**

1. **🔑 Official Requirement** - Exact CMMC v2 wording in highlighted box
2. **🎯 Why This Matters** - Business impact, CUI protection, audit implications
3. **🏢 How MVL Does It** - Specific MVL tools and processes (Entra ID, Zscaler, etc.)
4. **🛠️ Implementation Steps** - 6-step detailed implementation process
5. **🧠 Knowledge Check** - 5-question comprehensive quiz with instant feedback
6. **📚 Additional Resources** - Links to NIST, Microsoft docs, vendor guides

### **🎨 Professional Visual Design:**

- **Modern Card Layout** - Clean, sectioned design with distinct headers
- **Color-Coded Sections** - Blue gradient headers for easy navigation
- **Interactive Elements** - Hover effects, clickable quiz options
- **Progress Tracking** - Completion status and navigation
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

### **🧠 Enhanced Quiz System:**

- **5 Comprehensive Questions** covering practical scenarios
- **Real-time Feedback** - Immediate correct/incorrect highlighting
- **Score Calculation** - Pass/fail with visual indicators
- **Practical Scenarios** - Real-world MVL-specific situations

## 🔗 **Example: AC.L2-3.1.1 Implementation**

The first lesson (Access Control) now includes:

### **📋 Official Requirement:**
> **CMMC v2 – AC.L2-3.1.1**  
> "Limit system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other systems)."

### **🎯 Why This Matters:**
- Stops randos (and malware) from creeping into MVL's stuff
- Protects Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) so we keep our DoD cred  
- Required for NIST 800-171 ⟶ CMMC Level 2 certification — fail here and the audit is an instant L

### **🏢 How MVL Does It:**
1. **Entra ID SSO + MFA** → every legit user passes MFA before touching GCC G5 apps
2. **Zscaler Private Access** → only ZPA-enrolled endpoints can even see internal services
3. **Conditional Access rules** lock out non-compliant devices (BitLocker off? Bye)
4. **HR off-boarding feed** ⟶ Entra ► user disabled within 30 min of termination

### **🛠️ Implementation Steps:**
1️⃣ **Policy Draft** – Write "MVL Access Control Policy" (owner: CISO)  
2️⃣ **Entra Conditional Access** – Require MFA + compliant device, deny legacy auth  
3️⃣ **Zscaler Enrollment** – Push ZPA client via Intune; map users to apps  
4️⃣ **Least-Privilege Audit** – Run weekly PowerShell to find elevated roles; ticket any outliers  
5️⃣ **Train Users** – 5-min Actimo micro-module + quiz  
6️⃣ **Doc & Sign-off** – Capture screenshots, export CA policies JSON; COO e-signs change log  

### **🧠 Knowledge Check Examples:**
- **Q1:** Which combo below BEST satisfies AC.L2-3.1.1 at MVL?
  - **B.** Entra ID SSO + MFA ✅
- **Q3:** You just off-boarded an engineer. What's the FIRST action to stay compliant?
  - **B.** Disable their Entra ID account within 30 minutes ✅
- **Q5:** Contractor connects via hotel Wi-Fi on personal MacBook. MFA passes but BitLocker isn't enabled. What happens?
  - **C.** ZPA blocks the session; Conditional Access flags non-compliant device ✅

## 🔄 **Ready for Mass Generation**

### **Template Created:**
The enhanced lesson page serves as a perfect template for generating all 109 lessons. Each lesson will include:

- **Consistent Professional Format**
- **MVL-Specific Implementation Details**
- **Practical Quiz Questions**
- **Real-world Scenarios**

### **Next Steps for Full Curriculum:**
1. **Confirm** this AC.L2-3.1.1 lesson meets your requirements
2. **Apply same format** to all remaining 108 lessons
3. **Customize content** for each CMMC control
