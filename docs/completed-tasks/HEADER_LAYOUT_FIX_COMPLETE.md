# Header Layout Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The header logo and content were overlapping across different screen sizes due to:
- Flexible layout without fixed frame dimensions
- Inconsistent sizing for logo and text containers
- Navigation elements competing for space with logo section
- Lack of proper overflow handling

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Logo Container Dimensions
**Before**: Variable sizing with `min-w-0` and `flex-shrink`
**After**: Fixed size containers:
- Mobile: 48px Ã— 48px logo frame
- Tablet: 56px Ã— 56px logo frame  
- Desktop: 64px Ã— 64px logo frame
- Large: 80px Ã— 80px logo frame

### 2. Fixed Header Section Frames
**Logo Section**:
- Large screens: 280px - 420px width (fixed)
- XL screens: 320px - 480px width
- 2XL screens: 380px - 560px width

**Navigation Section**:
- Large screens: 300px - 500px width (fixed)
- XL screens: 350px - 600px width
- 2XL screens: 400px - 700px width

### 3. Prevented Content Overflow
- Added `overflow: hidden` to logo containers
- Applied `text-overflow: ellipsis` for long text
- Used `whitespace-nowrap` for navigation links
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent element compression

### 4. Enhanced Responsive Design
- Fixed minimum header heights: 80px (LG), 96px (XL), 112px (2XL+)
- Consistent spacing with proper gap controls
- Better mobile menu button positioning

## Files Modified

### components/header.html
- Restructured logo container with fixed dimensions
- Updated navigation section with proper spacing
- Added fixed width/height for logo elements
- Improved mobile menu button placement

### assets/css/overrides.css
- Added comprehensive responsive breakpoints
- Implemented fixed frame sizing system
- Enhanced logo sizing controls
- Added overflow protection rules

## Key Improvements

âœ… **Fixed Logo Frame**: Logo now has consistent, non-overlapping dimensions across all screen sizes

âœ… **Prevented Text Overflow**: Long text is properly truncated with ellipsis instead of wrapping

âœ… **Stable Navigation**: Navigation elements maintain fixed spacing and don't compress

âœ… **Responsive Layout**: Header adapts properly to different screen sizes while maintaining structure

âœ… **Consistent Spacing**: Proper gaps between header sections prevent overlap

âœ… **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile layout remains clean and functional

## Testing Results
- âœ… Main page (index.html) - Header displays correctly
- âœ… Courses page - Logo and navigation properly spaced
- âœ… Lesson pages - No overlap issues detected
- âœ… Responsive behavior - Works across different screen sizes

## Status
