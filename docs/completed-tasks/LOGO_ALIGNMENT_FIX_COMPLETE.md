# MVL Logo Alignment & Visual Integration Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Resolved
The MVL logo was displaying with a prominent white frame/border that made it look like a separate "boxed" element rather than being naturally integrated into the header. The alignment was also off, creating an unprofessional appearance.

## Visual Problems Fixed

### ❌ BEFORE (Problematic):
- Heavy white background container
- Prominent gray border (2px solid)
- Drop shadow effect creating separation
- Logo looked "boxed" and separate from header
- Alignment issues with header text
- Excessive padding making it bulky
- Logo appeared smaller (50px height)

### ✅ AFTER (Fixed):
- Clean, minimal container with no background
- No prominent borders or shadows
- Natural integration into header design
- Perfect alignment with header text
- Optimized spacing and padding
- Slightly larger logo (56px height)
- Professional, cohesive appearance

## Technical Changes Made

### Container Styling (Before):
```css
{
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  min-height: 50px;
  max-height: 70px;
  background: white;           /* ❌ Prominent background */
  border: 2px solid #e5e7eb;   /* ❌ Heavy border */
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 8px 16px;           /* ❌ Excessive padding */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15); /* ❌ Drop shadow */
  margin-right: 16px;
}
```

### Container Styling (After):
```css
{
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-right: 20px;          /* ✅ Optimized spacing */
  padding: 4px;                /* ✅ Minimal padding */
  /* ✅ No background, border, or shadow */
}
```

### Logo Sizing:
- **Before**: `height: 50px`
- **After**: `height: 56px` (slightly larger for better presence)

### Text Spacing:
- **Before**: `pl-6 ml-2` (extra margin causing alignment issues)
- **After**: `pl-6` (clean spacing)
