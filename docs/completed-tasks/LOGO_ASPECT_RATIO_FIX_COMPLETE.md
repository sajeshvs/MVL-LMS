# MVL Logo Aspect Ratio Fix - COMPLETED

## Issue Resolved
The MVL logo was being displayed in a compressed square format instead of its natural aspect ratio, making the logo appear distorted and unprofessional.

## Solution Implemented
Updated both the shared header component and standalone page to display the logo at its natural aspect ratio:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Container Height**: Changed from fixed `height: 64px` to `height: auto` with `min-height: 50px` and `max-height: 70px`
2. **Image Sizing**: Set `height: 50px` and `width: auto` to maintain natural proportions
3. **Constraint Removal**: Removed `max-width` limitations that were forcing compression
4. **CSS Overrides**: Added specific CSS rules to enforce natural aspect ratio

### Files Updated:
- `components/header.html` - Shared header component used by main pages
- `index-standalone.html` - Standalone page with embedded header
- `assets/css/overrides.css` - Added CSS rules for aspect ratio enforcement
- `logo-aspect-ratio-final.html` - Verification page for testing

## Technical Details

### Before (Compressed):
```css
width: auto !important; 
height: 64px !important; 
min-width: 120px !important; 
max-width: 200px !important;

img {
    width: auto !important; 
    height: 48px !important; 
    max-width: 180px !important;
}
```

### After (Natural Aspect Ratio):
```css
width: auto !important; 
height: auto !important; 
min-height: 50px !important;
max-height: 70px !important;

img {
    height: 50px !important; 
    width: auto !important;
    max-width: none !important;
}
```

## Testing Results
