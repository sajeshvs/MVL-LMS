## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Web server (for serving files - can be as simple as Python's built-in server)

### Installation
1. Download/clone all files to your web server directory
2. Ensure all files are accessible via HTTP (not file://)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

### Development Server
For local development, you can use any static file server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## üìù Customization

### Adding New Content
1. Enable edit mode in the admin panel
2. Click on any editable content area
3. Modify the content directly
4. Changes are saved automatically

### Branding
- Upload custom logo via admin panel
- Modify footer content to match your organization
- Colors and styling can be customized via `assets/css/overrides.css`

### Curriculum Updates
Edit `assets/js/curriculum.js` to:
- Add new courses/lessons
- Update existing content
- Modify MVL-specific tips and implementation guides

## üîß Maintenance

### Data Backup
Regular backups can be created via the admin panel:
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Data Management
2. Click "Export All Data"
3. Save the JSON file securely

### Content Recovery
If content is accidentally modified:
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Content Modifications
2. Find the modified element
3. Click "Revert" to restore original content

### Performance
- All data is stored locally - no database required
- Minimal external dependencies (only CDN resources)
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- No user authentication required for single-user deployments

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All user data stays in browser localStorage
- No data transmitted to external servers (except CDN resources)
- No user authentication system (suitable for internal training)

### Content Security
- Admin panel controls who can edit content
- All changes are tracked with timestamps
- Easy rollback of content modifications

## üìä Analytics & Reporting

The system tracks:
- Individual lesson completion rates
- Course progress percentages
- Quiz performance and attempts
- Time spent on content (via timestamps)
- Content modification history

Data can be exported as JSON for analysis in external tools.

## ü§ù Support

This is a self-contained system designed for MVL Group's internal training needs. For technical issues:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all files are properly served via HTTP
3. Ensure localStorage is not disabled in browser
4. Check that CDN resources are accessible
