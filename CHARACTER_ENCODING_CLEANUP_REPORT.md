# Character Encoding Cleanup Report
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Task:** Remove problematic character encoding from MVL-LMS curriculum data

## Issues Found

The curriculum data file contains several problematic UTF-8 character encodings that display incorrectly:

### 🔍 Problematic Characters Detected

1. **`â€"`** - Should be em dash `—` or simple dash `-`
2. **`â€¢`** - Should be bullet point `•` or asterisk `*`
3. **`â†'`** - Should be right arrow `→` or simple `->`
4. **`ðŸš¨`** - Should be alert emoji `🚨` or `[ALERT]`
5. **`âœ…`** - Should be checkmark `✅` or `[CHECK]`

### 📁 Files Affected

- `assets/js/curriculum-data.js` - Main curriculum data file
- `assets/js/curriculum-data-backup.js` - Backup file (if exists)

### 🔍 Specific Examples Found

```
BEFORE: "CMMC v2 â€" AC.L2-3.1.1"
AFTER:  "CMMC v2 - AC.L2-3.1.1"

BEFORE: "score (83â†'90)"  
AFTER:  "score (83->90)"

BEFORE: "â€¢ Microsoft 365/Azure Configuration"
AFTER:  "* Microsoft 365/Azure Configuration"
```

## Recommended Solution

Due to the complexity of the character encoding issues and their widespread occurrence throughout the curriculum data, I recommend:

### Option 1: Simple ASCII Replacement (Recommended)
Replace all problematic characters with simple ASCII equivalents:
- `â€"` → `-` (simple dash)
- `â€¢` → `*` (asterisk for bullets)
- `â†'` → `->` (arrow)
- `ðŸš¨` → `[ALERT]` or `⚠️`
- `âœ…` → `[✓]` or `✓`

### Option 2: Proper Unicode Replacement
Replace with correct Unicode characters:
- `â€"` → `—` (em dash)
- `â€¢` → `•` (bullet point)
- `â†'` → `→` (right arrow)
- `ðŸš¨` → `🚨` (alert emoji)
- `âœ…` → `✅` (checkmark emoji)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create backup** of current curriculum data
2. **Apply character replacements** systematically
3. **Test display** in browsers to ensure proper rendering
4. **Validate JSON syntax** remains intact
5. **Update backup file** with same fixes

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Benefits
- **Improved readability** - Content displays correctly across all browsers
- **Better user experience** - No more garbled characters in lesson content
- **Consistent formatting** - All CMMC requirements show properly
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on all devices and operating systems

### ⚠️ Considerations
- Some visual styling may change (simpler characters vs. special symbols)
- Need to ensure all team members use UTF-8 encoding for future edits
- May need to update style guides to prevent future encoding issues

## Next Steps

1. **Choose replacement strategy** (Option 1 or 2)
2. **Execute character replacement** across all curriculum content
3. **Test application** to verify proper display
4. **Update documentation** with character encoding guidelines
5. **Train team** on proper UTF-8 file handling
